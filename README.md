# OpenAIAssistant
This repository contains the code and instructions on integrating an OpenAI Assistant with your application using Python. 

I created this repository for those who find the integration of OpenAI assistants difficult, just like I did when I was building a project with my team in a hackathon. 
This repository contains a Python module that has all the necessary code for a seamless integration alongside a Jupyter Notebook that has the necessary step-by-step instructions and explanation of the code. 

In case you want help with the integration in the backend, feel free to reach out to me at `hr328@cornell.edu`, and I will be more than happy to help. Peace!
